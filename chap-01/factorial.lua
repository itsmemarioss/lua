When the interpreter loads a file, it ignores its first line if that line starts with a number sign (`#Â´). That feature allows the use of Lua as a script interpreter in Unix systems. If you start your program with something like

    #!/usr/local/bin/lua
(assuming that the stand-alone interpreter is located at /usr/local/bin), or
    #!/usr/bin/env lua
then you can call the program directly, without explicitly calling the Lua interpreter.
The usage of lua is

    lua [options] [script [args ] ]
